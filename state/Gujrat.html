                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The Gujarati's get their lineage from the Gurjars who came to India along with the Huns and when they were travelling and had to cross through Punjab they got settled in Gujarat. The
                            Gujarati's are mainly Indo Aryan origin and of which at least 20% constitute the tribal group like Bhils, Kolis, Dhubla, Naikda and Macchi-Kharwa who still exist in the state. Though the
                            state was invaded by the Aryans who came from the north, they were not able to either conquer or send away the tribes of the Bhil community who soon became the traditional rulers of
                            Gujarat. The Koli community of Kurjars also occupies standard position between the Aryans and the Bhils. The culture of Gujarat can be best expressed as comprising the following.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>Gujarat soon became a multi-religious culture for the fact that during the medieval period there was lot of immigration into the state which brought Islam and Zoroastrianism with lot of
                            followers for it. Predominant of the Guajarati who settled down in Saurashtra during the fourteenth century were known as Kathis and they were the worshippers of the Sun god. The
                            Kathis being nomads were good in the art of horse-breeding. But again due to immigrants into this part of Gujarat led to a multi ethnic culture. Saurashtra was soon dominated by the
                            Rabris who belong to the royal families. The Rabri community was mainly cattle breeders and had their lineage from a Rajput clan. </p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>Culture Of Gujarat Gujarat which derives its name from the term 'Gujjar Rashtra' constitutes a culture which is formed out of mingling of diverse ethnic folks. The flourishing state of 
                            Gujarat with its cultural diversity forms an integral part of the Indian culture and has long been harboring both, the indigenous and foreign traditions.</p>
