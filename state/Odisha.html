                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>here are lot of mention about the people of Odisha in historical epics like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Manu Samhita, Natyashastra of Bharata Muni and various Indian Puranas and other
                            religious texts of ancient India. But still there no records which gives an exact picture of the original inhabitants of the people of Odisha. In history the early period has records of the
                            people of Odisha belonging to a race known as Odras and the name of their country was named accordingly. The people from the Odras racial community where those who were
                            inhabiting this region and are believed to be the earliest Aryan settlers. The Odras people accordingly were the Vratyas in the institutes of Manu, are described as those who do not adhere
                            to or follow any customs or religious rites and so they were treated with disrespect and devoid of their caste.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>The Odras were placed in par with the Poundras and Dravidas. They also came in terms with mutual concession with the mighty Kalingas and the Dravidians of the adjoining area and at least for quite 
                            a long period they resided together which resulted in certain traits of their culture leading to resentment of the Vedic Aryans. These people who are known for their heroic deeds and being great 
                            warriors drove away the tribal people who were the earliest dwellers of this region to hilly areas and the Vratyas are settled in the fertile plains and even today popularly known as the Odiyas
                             who are the successful agriculturists of the state. Later these people were defeated by the Utkalas and the Vratyas had to shift themselves to mountainous regions of Western Odisha. 
                             The Savaras who count more than one million now living in Odisha claim themselves to be the earliest inhabitants of Odisha.

                            These people who made their entry from the north eastern state can be defined as those very primitive nor can you term them to have a decent cultural background. Thus the present style of
                             the living of the people of Odisha is a result of the racial and cultural amalgamation. Also the geography of the state contributes to its culture for the state stands as a coastal corridor b
                             etween the northern and southern India and having a blend of the races and cultures of the Aryans and the Dravidians. Though the people and the state are slowly getting urbanized, 
                             still certain primitive traditions and values are kept alive in its original or ancient form for the major portion of the state is largely in its rural form. The people of Odisha 
                             are known for their rich cultural heritage and have an amalgamation of the Jagannath cult, the Vaishnav cult and Buddhism and Sivayat cult. Odia apart from being the oldest language
                              of the state is also the most commonly spoken and the official language of the state where at least 85% of the total population speak this language. There is also other tribal 
                              languages spoken by the different group of tribal people.
