                        <p>The people of Uttarakhand are commonly known as 'paharis' or the people from the hills. It is a multi-ethnic populated state with Rajputs which include members of the native Garhwali,
                            Gujjar, and Kumauni communities. Apart from this there are number of immigrants in Uttarakhand who constitute the population. Nearly one fifth of the total population are the
                            Scheduled Castes and they are referred as Kols or Doms. The Raji community people who fall under the scheduled tribes dwell in the bordering areas of Nepal and they account for less
                            than 5 percent of the population. Though the people of Uttarakhand come from a heterogenous ethnic background they still adhere to their unique culture and traditions. Mostly the people
                            are from rural areas and live in slate-roofed houses, terraced fields and traditional costumes. </p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>We have the Garhwali and also the Kumaonis living in Uttarakhand. The Bhotias, the Jaunsaries, the Tharus, the Bokshas and the Rajis are the notable ethnic group of people living in
                            Uttarakhand. The people mainly speak Indo-Aryan language, of which Hindi is the most widely spoken and the official language of the state. Other languages prevalent in the state are
                            Hindustani which is a mix of Hindi and Urdu, Garhwali, Kumauni, Punjabi, and Nepali. Apart from the Hindus and Muslims, the state also houses smaller communities of Sikhs,
                            Christians, Buddhists, and Jains. There is a nomadic community of Muslims seen here and they are mainly into animal husbandry.The ethnicity of the people of Uttarakhand involves a

                            the culture of Uttarakhand where the people here are bestowed with Land of Gods, natural diversity and the element of the Himalaya's unparalleled with its natural beauty and sanctity.
                            Thus there are so many geo -social factors which influences the culture of the people of Uttarakhand. The religious bonds between the people is held tight by features like music, dance

                            the slightest possible opportunity to celebrate all the festivals of India with great enthusiasm</p>
                
                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>The people of Uttarakhand follow the ancestor spirit worship. They believe that by doing this kind of worship they wake up the Gods and the local deities from their inactive stage to solve their problems and shower their blessings. 
                            It is a traditional belief that that by doing this they get divine justice. On such occasions music plays a major role and act as a medium to invoke the Gods. The singer or Jagariya sings a ballad of the gods with allusions to 
                            the great epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana and which describes the adventures and exploits of the god being invoked. This is a very common custom prevalent among most of the Hindu people in Uttarakhand. 
                            The people are deep rooted in religious faiths and superstitions for any good thing they do, they depend on the astrological forecast of the Brahmins for its auspiciousness. 
                            They follow age old customs and traditions for all social functions like new birth, marriage, death, etc. Shiva and Durga are the most important Gods of the people of Uttarakhand and many fairs and festivals are held in regard with 
                            the above mentioned Gods. People believe in ghosts, witches, etc., and tantra-mantra are used to cure disease and prevent calamities. Tantra-Mantra plays an important role in some customs which are executed at
                            the places called 'Shiddhpith' and on the confluence of two rivers. At such times they sacrifice buffalos, goats and sheep to please the God or Goddess.
