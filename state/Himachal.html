                            were followed by the second phase of migrants known as Bhotas and Kiratas who were Mongoloid in origin. However the base of the history and culture of Himachal Pradesh were
                            formed by the third phase of the migrants namely the Aryans who moved from Central Asia and got settled in the fertile plains of Punjab. Himachal Pradesh is predominantly occupied by
