                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                            <p>The people of Tripura are mostly known as Tripuris and they are mostly tribes. They are mainly of Tibeto-Burmese origin. Their origin dates back to more than 2000 years and it were
                                these Tripuri people who ruled the state of Tripura. The tribal people of Tripura have a very interesting history which states that the people originally belonged to other foreign countries
                                like Tibet and Burma who migrated from there much before 65 AD and settled down in the North Eastern part of the country, namely Tripura. There are records from epics which states
                                that the Tripuri tribes are also known as Puran Tripuri and Dev Varma who had ancestral relation with the lunar dynasty of Mahabharata. The Tripuri tribes scattered mostly in the western
                                and northern parts of the Tripura have also resisted the entry of the Mughal invaders earlier. </p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                            <p>The Tripuri tribes have a mixed economy. The tribes of Tripura who are mostly old fashioned in character have long classifications of class and there is a representative from each clan to
                                discharge certain duties to the royal family of the state. Some of the prominent clans of the Tripuri's are Bachal, Siuk, Koaitoia, Daitys, Singh, Hojoria, Chiltia, Apaia, Chatratoia, Galim,
                                Sube Naran, Sena, Jolai, and Khakloo. Reangs, Jamatias, Chakma, Halam and Usai are the other groups of tribal people living in this area. The population is largely Bengali in spite of 19
                                Scheduled Tribes.The people of Tripura show a diverse ethnicity with two major racial groups namely the Bengalese who are Indo-Aryans by origin. The Indo-Mongloids are represented
                                by a few other communities like the Tripuris, the Reangs, the Jamatis, the Noatias, the Kukis, the Halams, the Chakma, the Mogh and the Lushai. Apart from the above mentioned major
                                tribes, there are also ten more tribes and these nineteen tribes are collectively classified as 'Scheduled Tribes'. The native inhabitants of the state are known as Tipras and they constitute
                                about 16 percent of the total and 57% of the tribal population of the state.Though the rulers of the initial period were the descendants of the Kshatriyas they got very much influenced by
                                the language, culture and custom of the Bengalis resulted in a breakaway group of the original (Puram) Tripuris and formed a new community called as the Natun Tripuris.T
