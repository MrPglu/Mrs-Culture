                        <p>The people of Sikkim are more commonly known as the Sikkimese. The prehistoric times of the state of Sikkim was occupied by three tribes namely Naong, Chang and the Mon. But
                            however they were soon overtaken by the groups of people who were mainly from the neighboring country namely the Lepcha who belonged to the clan of Nagas. Soon Sikkim had three
                            groups of major tribal people namely the Lepcha who migrated from Tibet, the Bhutias who are the descendants of Buddhists from Tibet and finally the Nepalese from Nepal and they are
                            the descendants of Hindus.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>The Nepalese constitute the majority of the population of the people of Sikkim of about nearly 67% followed by the Bhutias of about 16% and then the Lepcha contributing 13% of the
                            total population. The people of Sikkim are nature worshippers and peace loving and they still stick on to this feature. Nepali is the most common spoken language spoken by the people of
                            Sikkim but other languages like Bhutia, Dzongkha, Groma, Gurung, Kafle, Lepcha, Limbu, Magar, Majhi, Majhwar, Nepal Bhasa, Rai, Sherpa, Sunuwar, Tamang, Thulung, Tibetan, and
                            Yakha are also spoken by different groups of tribal people. The majority of the people living here in Sikkim are Hindus which is nearly 60.9% and Buddhism religion is followed by at
                            least 28.1% of the population. The Lepcha tribes are mostly converted to Christians after the British missionaries who came during the 19th century.
