                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The Jats dominate the state of Haryana and they claim themselves to be of Rajput origin who came from Malwa, Bikaner and Dharangar near the ancient Hastinapur.The jats are further
                            divided into twelve chief clans (gotras) and about 137 minor gotras. Gatwallas or the maliks form the main group of people along with Dahiya, Ahlawat,Rathi, Dalal, Sahrawat, Kadian,
                            Jakhar, Golia and Deswal.The Mullas belong to the separate Muslim Jats. The economy of Harayana is mainly dependent on agriculture which inturn is dependent on Jats who are the
                            typical peasant caste. Nearly 90% of the population of Haryana is dominated by the Hindus and the Sikh population of Haryana is concentrated more towards the northeast and northwest
                            and the Muslims are settled in the southeastern districts adjoining Delhi. One fifth of the population is also taken over by the Harijan community. Though the Islam community living here
                            does not preach their religion here, they are divided into three categories namely the higher caste being taken over by the Asharf or Sharaf (noble), the middle class by the Ajlaf (base or
                            mean) and the lower caste by the Arzal.The Jats are supposed to be excellent cultivators. Haryanvi is the mother tongue of the people of Haryana with a dialect of Hindi and Punjabi.
                            Punjabi is the second official language of Haryana.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>Dating back to 4,500 years the people of the Harappan civilization were the first to occupy the land of Harayana. Later the Aryans from Central Asia started to migrate from there and
                            started settling down in places like Punjab and Haryana because of the mighty river and its tributaries in this area of the Indian subcontinent. Thus the current population of the people
                            Haryana has their ethnic origin to the Aryan race. This is clearly proved by the external features of the people who are tall with sharp features and wheatish colour.Though they are quite
                            aggressive in nature they are very good at heart. The people are bound by a common interest which is their liking for milk and milk products which is an essential part of their diet</p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>The culture of Haryana dates back to the Vedic times and the people are noted for their rich cultural heritage. The people of Haryana are known for their rich folklore and strictly adhere to
                            their own traditions and customs. The people of Haryana follow meditation, Yoga and chanting of Vedic Mantras which has become an integral part of their life. This way of life of the
                            people of Haryana is age old customs. The culture of the people is extoled by their seasonal and religious festivals. The people are known for their diverse races, cultures and faiths which
                            are blended in the right proportion to become something truly India. Even today they are preserving and follow their old religious and social traditions including fairs and festivals which
                            are celebrated following all the traditional customs.</p>
                
                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>Most of the people of Haryana have more or less equal social status. The status factor comes up only with the age which is understood and respected. The elders no matter how poor or
                            rich is given all the due respect in any place whereas the younger as a part of their social custom has to respect the older people even if the junior is very rich or socially placed in a high
                            status. Thus the tradition of the state of Haryana is very socialistic in nature. When it comes to marriage, a boy and a girl of the same gotra are not allowed to marry and the marriage is a
                            must within the same community. A boy and a girl of the same gothra are considered to be brother and sister. If marriages do not take place within the same Jat then it is considered as a
                            great disgrace to the boy or the girl family and is never accepted. Marriage within the same village is also not permitted even if the boy and girl qualify for marriage according to gotra
                            restriction. By following this custom the people are able to maintain racial purity and this factor of limiting within the community helps in promoting good health and prevention of
                            physical degeneration. The people of Haryana do not promote karewa or widow marriage which is a very big obligation among the community</p>
            
                <h2>ARTS AND CRAFTS</h2>
                        <p>Panipat, a major textile town in Haryana is noted for its rugs and upholstery fabric. Other handicrafts of the people of Haryana include woven furniture, artistic pottery and woodcarving.
                            The furniture produced by the people are quite famous and they are woven furniture - modhas (round stools) and chairs made of sarkande (a reed) from Faroukhnagar; and pidhis from
                            Sonepat, which are essentially wooden stools with seats woven in cotton thread or sutli.</p>

                        their own traditions and customs. The people of Haryana follow meditation, Yoga and chanting of Vedic Mantras which has become an integral part of their life. This way of life of the
