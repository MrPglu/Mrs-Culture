                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The history of the origin of the Marathis dates back to more than two millennia. The Marathi people take the pride of being the 17th largest ethnic group in India. The existence of the
                            community of the state of Maharashtra came prominent only during the period of Shivaji who established the Maratha Empire in 1674.The Maharashtrians occupy the state of Mahrashtra
                            which is in the western region of India and they basically belong to the Indo-Aryan ethnic group. The Maharasthrians speak Marathi language which is a part of the southern group of
                            Indo-Aryan languages. It was during the 20th century, that the people belonging to the peasant community of the Indo-Aryan Kshatriya Marathi class who were described as Kunbi started
                            using the word Maratha to describe them. Thus today the former Indo-Aryan Kshatriya Kunbi caste as well as the 96 clan upper caste Maratha group is referred more specifically as the
                            Marathas. </p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>The residents of the Maharashtra state along with their culture, language and lifestyle are known as the Marath's whereas the Maharashtrians refers to those people who have migrated to
                            Maharashtra from other regions of India, who may or may not observe the authentic culture and language. Apart from the people living in the urban area there are many tribal
                            communities like Bhils, Mahadeo, Kolis, Gonds and Warlis who occupy the land in the Deccan plateau. These tribal people strictly adhere to their lifestyles and traditions for they are still
                            not exposed to modernization.

                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>During Vinayaka Chaturthi the people of Maharashtra follow a number of traditional customs. On the mythical birth anniversary of Lord Ganesha the people create the idols of Ganesha,
                            decorate it and place it on a raised platform. It is a traditional practice to have the idol worshipped for ten days and on the eleventh day the people end the festival by carrying the idol on
                            the streets by singing and dancing and then immerse the statue in the water. The celebration of this festival is an indication of the euphoria of the Maharastrian people. The Mahrashtrians
                            celebrate the festival of Light, Diwali for nearly four days. On these days as a traditional custom the people light lot of diyas with a belief to take away all evil factors from their life. 
                            COSTUMES
                            The traditional attire of men in Maharashtra is the dhoti and shirt. Most of the elderly men wear the Pheta or the head dress which is a matter of respect. The Pheta is a folded turban made
                            of cotton, silk or woolen fabric. A waistcoat known as "Bandi" is also worn at times on top of the shirt. The Maratha Brahmans are very particular about the securing of their dhoti, which
                            always had to have five tucks, three into the waistband at the two sides and in front, while the loose end is tucked in front and behind. But however with more of modernization today the
                            use of Dhoti is getting extinct among the people of Maharashtra. T</p>
