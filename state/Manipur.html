                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The People of Manipur are popularly known as Manipuris and they fall under two main classes namely the Bishnupriyas and the Meiteis. Apart from these two main classes the land is
                            inhibited by numerous tribes. It is believed that the Bishnupriyas are Indo Aryans belonging to the Kshatriyas and are firm by origin. They actually descended from the Aryan invaders
                            who during the pre- Christian era passed through the hilly area of Manipur. The features of these ethnic people are very sharp resembling exactly to that of the Indo Aryans. Unlike the
                            other racial groups of the North-east region of the country, the people of Manipur or the Manipuris are tall and physically strong by nature.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>Though the Meiteis are believed to be the Kuki-Chin branch of the Mongolians, there are also other controversies regarding their origin. There are theories which states that the Meiteis
                            are Aryans by origin or they are the descendants of Arjuna of Mahabharata. The valleys of Manipur are dominated by Bishnupriyas, Meiteis, Pangal, and "Bhamons" whereas the hilly
                            areas of the state are occupied by the Naga, Kuki, and smaller tribal communities. The ethnicity of Manipur shows that there are a number of ethnic groups inhabiting the state but still all
                            are of the same Mongoloid group where almost all their cultural and traditional features are similar. The Manipuris are broadly classified into three major communities namely the Meiteis
                            who occupy the valleys of Manipur and two major tribal groups namely the Nags and Kuki-Chins.The Bamon and the Pangans are grouped under the Meiteis. The common language
                            widely spoken by the people of Manipur is Manipuri. </p>

                            of the people of Manipur is mainly built by their religion. Manipur being predominantly occupied by the tribal people, they have a strong belief in supernatural power that organizes and animates
