                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>

                                castes. The people of Bihar had long been under the fetters of superstition but modern reasoning is making the way for a reasonable society. The Bihari languages include Magahi, Bajjika,
                                Bhojpuri, Maithili, Hindi and Urdu. The culture of Bihar can be best expressed as comprising the following</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                            <p>A group of proposers from Nepal belonging to the Madheshi identity state that Bihari is a technical term that excludes homogenous peoples of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Terai Madhesh. Thus it is believed that the Madheshi from Madhyadesh is the apt word for the ethnic group of which Bihari and several closely related linguistic groups like Awadhi, Bundeli,
                                Bagheli, etc. could originate from. The Bihari's are divided into five castes and they are the Brahman, Bhumihar, Rajput, Banias, and Kayastha. Among these castes the Kayastha and the
                                Banias are the most dominant castes of the Biharis. Brahmans are the most superior among the castes in Bihar; whereas the Bhumihars are considered to be socially inferior. Ahirs,
                                Kurmis, Koiris are the group of people who own land. There are small counts of scheduled caste people in Bihar and they are Bhumji, Chamar, Dhobi, Dom, Dusadh, Musahar, Nat and Pasi.</p>
