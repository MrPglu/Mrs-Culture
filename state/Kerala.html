                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>Kerala situated in the South of India has its origin dating back to the early 10th century. There are legends associated with the origin of the state which proclaims that Parasurama, an
                            Avatar of Mahavishnu during a war threw his axe into the sea and as a result of which the state of Kerala was retrieved from the water. But geological origin states two reasons for its
                            origin, where the former proclaims that the vibrations of the earth and its crust would have resulted in the coming up of the state.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>One of the reasons for the coming up of the state may be even due to the siliting of the rivers in South India. History says that the early inhabitants of Kerala during the Neolithic times
                            were mainly the Negritos who had a good knowledge of ayurvedic medicines and were also efficient in explaining the natural phenomenon. Followed by the Negritos came the ProtoAustraloids who takes the pride of introducing cultivation of rice and vegetables. Then by 700 BC came the Dravidians who are the ancestors of the recent Malayalees from the
                            Mediterranean region. It was during this time that Kerala was influenced by the Mayrayan and then the Cheran Kingdom and feudal Namboothri Brahminical became major powers in the
                            region. By this period the development of Mayalam took place and Kerala became a linguistically distinct region in the early 14th century. Kerala which was taken over by the Cheras
                            soon allied with the Pallavas and defeated the Chola and Pandya kingdoms</p>

                            language, art, education and social organization which has its own distinct malayali characteristics. Both the Aryan and the Dravidian culture are synthesized to get the present culture of
                            the Keralites who have taken all the pain to maintain the antiquity of the region. The Koodiyattom takes the pride of being announced by the UNESCO as the Human Heritage Art. This
                            performing art is a form of drama or theatrical representation of epic stories of Gods</p>
                
                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>Kerala fondly known as God's own country has a wonderful tradition in the history of Malayalis with lot of ethnic values and cultures. Apart from Hinduism, Christianity and Muslims
