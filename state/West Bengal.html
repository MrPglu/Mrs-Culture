                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The people of West Bengal are more popularly known as Bengali's and they speak the Bangla or the Bengali language which belongs to the Indo-Aryan group of the Indo-Iranian branch
                            of the Indo-European language family. The people living in this north- eastern part of the country have close similarity to that of those in the country Bangladesh. There were different
                            groups of people belonging to various communities who came into this state thus resulting in the diverse origin of the people of the state. However there are records which states that the
                            earliest residents are said to have come from Veda in Sri Lanka and they were soon merged by the Indo-European language speaking Mediterranean people. Towards the end of the 8th
                            century there were people entering into West Bengal who had their lineage from various groups like the Arabs, Turkish and Persians.The mix of these people put together is now known as
                            the Bengalis. Most of the Bengalis follow the religion of Hinduism.</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>The people of Bengal have at least five different racial groups which resulted in a rich inter mixture of these racial strains. However the people of Proto-Australian origin are supposed to
                            be the oldest in the group of population. Nishads were indigenous tribe inhabiting ancient India mainly in the plateau fringe and beyond into Chhotanagpur and central India. They had
                            features distinct to their community like long head, dark skin, broad-nose and short stature. These people make the lowest castes in Bengal, the peasants and they were labeled as Negritos
                            or the Negroids. Next was the entry of the Dravidians from the northern Mediterranean region who were characterized by long heads, tall, sharp nose and prominent chin. The Dravidians
                            were closely followed by the round headed Sumerians from the Western region. The fair- skinned Alpines or Indo-Aryans came in to Bengal who were featured with oval face, </p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>The culture of the Bengalis gives a special identity to the state with various unique features of heritage in its music, cinema and specially its literature. The Bengalis boast of one of the
                            richest and vibrant culture in India which is a perfect blend of modernity and tradition. The people of Bengal have contributed a lot towards the creation of such a magnificent atmosphere.
                            The Bengalis were not only pioneers in reformation movements but also the people of Bengal were the first to experience the cosmopolitan culture in the country. Some of the important
                            constituents of the culture of the Bengalis are its music, Bengali cinema, Bengali literature and of course the Bengali cuisine. The sanctity of Hooghly, the beauty of Eastern Himalayas,
                            the diversity of Sunderbans and the freshness of the Tea Gardens, all blend together to constitute what we call the unique culture of West Bengal. Bengal is the birth place of several social
                            reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Vidyasagar, great saint Ram Krishna Paramahamsa and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. The Bengalis are said to have inherited a rich genetic
                            features from their earlier generations which is proved by the popular saying 'What Bengal thinks today, Rest of India will think tomorrow'.

                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>Apart from the religious rituals and ceremonials the people of Bengal or the Bengalis have their own rituals in ceremonies like birth, weddings and even death. The Gaye holud is a part of
                            a custom of the Bengali wedding and it takes place one or two days prior to the occasion. The Gaye holud is also known as the turmeric function during which haldi is applied on the skin
                            of the bride and the groom for it is believed that turmeric cleanses, soften and brighten the skin, giving the bride's skin the distinctive yellow hue that gives its name to this ceremony.
                            According to Bengalis, the weddings symbolizes purity, sanctity and other good aspects of life. During a wedding ceremony Bengalis do not opt for black colour for it is considered as the
                            colour of evil whereas they prefer hues of red which signifies luck, emotion and fortune. Banana tree is used to decorate the wedding mandaps and the house for banana tree produces
                            huge number of fruits at a time and so also the couple should be blessed with many children. A ritual known as Annaprashan is conducted for the babies when it is five to seven months
                            old. This is just to welcome the baby to eat the normal home-made food after it crosses the stage of eating baby food pattern.
