                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The people of Nagaland are generally known as Naga's and they constitute several groups of tribals occupying the North Eastern part of India and north-western Burma. These
                            conglomerations of tribes mostly have identical culture and traditions and form the majority ethnic group in the Indian states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. The
                            people of Nagaland get their name Naga from the Burmese word "NAKA" which means people of perforated ears to adorn themselves with big wooden plugs and other ornaments.
                            Basically their origin is of the Indo-Mongoloid family and these tribes of the hilly region are characterized physically by a medium height, very low facial index with straight hair and eyes
                            different from that of the Mongolian form. </p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>Some of the major tribal sects of the people of Nagaland are Angami, Ao, Chakhesang, Chang, Khemungan, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Sema, Yimchunger,
                            Poumai, Rongmei Naga, Maram Naga, Nocte, Phom, Pochuri, Tangsa, Tutsa, Zeliang and Wancho. The Chakhesangs were earlier known as Eastern Angamis and are a combination of the
                            Chakri, Khezha and Sangtam sub-tribes. Each tribal community have their own unique cultural features and various distinct languages like Tibeto-Burman, Angamiâ€“Pochuri, Ao, Kukish,
                            Sal, Tangkhul, Thangal,Maram, Nagamese creole and Zeme. The people of Nagaland belong to several tribal communities which in turn is further divided into a number of sub-tribal
                            sections where all of them are believed to have derived their origin from the Indo-Mongoloid family. One of the most unique features of these ethnic groups in Nagaland is that they all
                            wish to live in rural areas following their culture and traditions rather than moving onto urban areas.</p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>The culture and the social structure of the Nagas vary from one tribal community to another. There was a lot of inter- village quarrels happening in earlier days for choosing the sites for the village and was very much influenced by considerations of defensive strategy. The houses were usually built on the top of the hills enclosed with stone walls and heavy wooden gates with deep ditches dug around the wall. The dance of the Naga's is an example for the proof of the vibrant and dynamic cultural traditions of the north eastern state of India. The folk dances of the Naga's accompanied with excellent folk songs and native musical instruments clearly indicate the rich cultural heritage of the people of Nagaland. The dance of the Naga's is mainly dominated by the male members of the community who are fully dressed in traditional costumes and they usually dance in groups more preferably in closed circles. Each tribal community has their unique style of dance form. Some of the famous dances of the people of Nagaland are Zeliang dance, Cock dance, Fly dance, Cricket dance and Bear dance. An integral part of social and cultural lifestyle of the native population of Nagaland, the unique dancing styles of the state are performed with proper props of dao, shield or spear. The folk music of the Naga's again shows diversity in their melodious traditional rhythm depending on the various communities of the tribal people. The music composed is mainly based on features like religious beliefs, romance or bravery.

                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>The people of Nagaland encourage marriage only outside of a social group. Thus people from the same community do not marry and also in case of any relationship between them then it
                            considered as a social evil. In the Angamis community if a young boy shows a liking towards a girl then he conveys it to his father after which a friend is send to confirm the wishes of the
                            elders. It the parents on the other side also agree then the bridegroom's father puts the matter further to the test by strangling a fowl and watching the way in which it crosses its legs when
                            dying. If the legs are placed in an inauspicious attitude, the match is immediately broken off. If things go well the marriage is fixed but the girl also has the right to break the marriage
                            even if she has some inauspicious dream.
                            </p>
            
                <h2>ARTS AND CRAFTS</h2>
                        <p>The Naga clothes which are so varied and rich in design not only serve the bare necessities of life but also reflect the socio political status and ritual significance from very design of the bearers.
                             The textile weaving varies from tribes to tribes. Cotton is grown in plenty in Nagaland and Naga clothes are made of local materials.
                            The motifs, designs, and pattern however are quite complex and their symbolic meanings and usages are rather significant. They use natural dye made of tree roots and leaves for colouring threads.
                            The Nagas are famous for their shawls. Different tribes of Nagas have different types of shawls off their own designs and within the same tribe everybody is not allowed to wear any type of shawls 
                            by their choice as they signifies the social standing own by the person.</p>
                
                <h2>CUISINE</h2>
                        <p>The various Naga people have their own cuisines, but often exchange recipes. A typical Naga meal consists of Rice, a meat dish, one or two boiled vegetable dishes, and a chutney/pickle (Tathu). 
                            Rice is the main carbohydrate source in the Naga diet and this region produces a number of prized rice varieties, but rice is also imported into the region from other states. Dried/smoked meat 
                            is a very important ingredient in Naga cuisine and has practical significance for sustenance farmers/foragers and hunters. Smoked meat is often kept for an entire year to provide food security 
                            for individual families. Nagas tend to prefer boiled edible organic leaves and wild forage which makes up a large part of the diet of many Naga region</p>
