                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                        <p>The people of Goa are commonly referred by the name Goan. The Goan origin may be contributed towards the Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic ethnic and linguistic ancestries.
                            This paves way for them to be considered as an ethno-linguistic group.The main language spoken by the people of Goa is Konkani belonging to the Southern group of Indo-Aryan
                            Languages and it is a Prakrit based language. The dialects of the Konkani language vary depending on the nativity of the people and some of them are Bardeskari, Sashtikari, Pednekari
                            and Antruj bhasha.The Hindu people living in Goa refer to themselves as Konkane or Devanagari who are mainly the residents of Konkan. The culture of Delhi can be best expressed as
                            comprising the following</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                        <p>The Konkani language spoken by the Christian people of Goa has a notable difference from that of the Hindus for it is influenced a lot by the Portuguese in its vocabulary. But however
                            during the rule of Portuguese, Konkani was suppressed to a great extent and then in the field of education especially for the Hindus, Marathi played a major role. There is a very small
                            minority of descendants of the Portuguese, most of who are of mixed descent and speak Portuguese who are mainly educated and follow for communication the Devanagari and Latin
                            script.</p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>The culture of the Goans dates back to the early period of civilization. Though there were lot of interference from the aliens resulting in ravages, still the traditional culture of the people
                            was strongly adhered for the Goans which gave them back a tough resistance for every challenge they faced. Goa's cultural heritage was enriched by a slow but persistent process of
                            absorption and assimilation of the more congenial features of alien culture. With a multicultural past the Goans have rich traditional customs and rituals which are followed. The culture of
                            the people is also influenced by the Goan cuisine. The culture of the Goans is a blend of their people, festivals, music and dance.</p>
                
                <h2>SOCIAL CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS</h2>
                        <p>The Goan customs and traditions are easily adaptable because of their lifestyle. The flexibility in their customs is mainly due to the fact that the place being reigned by different empires,
                            the customs and traditions have also got a shape according to the beliefs pertaining to that period of time. Thus the people do not really consider the traditional practices too hard. But still
                            there are certain customs and traditions which are very much adhered to like most of the houses built here follow the typical Portugal custom. Not only the old churches but also any new
                            church constructed here follows the typical traditional Portugal style. There are no hard and fast rules to follow a particular religion for they can have the choice of their own but still
                            respect the values of other religions too. This nature of the Goans makes them stand apart from the entire country and so their tradition and customs have truly given a unique identity to
                            the state and made it a role model for others.</p>
            
                <h2>ARTS AND CRAFTS</h2>
                        <p>Goa does not lag behind as far as arts and crafts are concerned and has turned out a good competitor in this creative field just like any other art enriched state of India. It can be said that art virtually
                            runs in their blood, which is manifested, in many artistic crafts that have attained commercial proportions. They make excellent souvenirs for tourists. Goan handicrafts include Creative Pottery, Shell Work, 
                            Furniture, Brass Work, Bamboo Work, Papier-Mache, etc. Goa is the product of the aesthetic blend of Portuguese and Indian cultures. The crafts of the state are intricately beautiful, capturing the fancies of 
                            tourists and locals alike. These crafts can be at best described as a mirror of Goa's perennial glory and beauty and they have carved a niche for themselves by winning critical acclaim of the connoisseurs of 
                            the art world. Click here for Art and Culture Tours in Goa</p>
                
                <h2>CUISINE</h2>
                        <p>The staple food of the Goan cuisine is fish curry and rice. The food is always a mix of Konkani, Brazillian and Portuguese food styles. Apart from fish, the
                        Catholics of Goa also eat beef and pork which is not common among the Hindus. Generally the food of the people of Goa is quite spicy. One of the most favorite
                        sea food delicacies is the Prawn Balham which is a spicy, oily, pickle- like preparation. Another special dish which is mainly served on occasions is the Pork
                        sorpotel. Mostly the dinner is always served with Chicken Cafreal which is a grilled preparation with a healthy amount of garlic paste. A popular desert among
                        the Goan is a sweet meat dish named Bebinca which is very rich and is eight layered, alternated with eggs, milk and sugar.</p>
