                <h2>CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
                            <p>The people of Assam are a mixture of Mongolian, Indo-Burmese, Indo-Iranian and Aryan origin. This mixture of people constitutes the population of the state and they call themselves as
                                ``Asomiya'' or ``Assamese'' and the language is also referred by the same. Among all the states of the country, Assam is said to have the largest number of tribes showing a great difference
                                in their tradition, culture, dresses, and exotic way of life. Their culture and traditions along with their language is very unique for the outsiders as they really wonder about the Assamese
                                of this north eastern state. Some of the major tribes of the Assamese are Boro (or Kachari), Karbi, Kosh-Rajbanshi, Miri, Mishimi and Rabha who show a variety in tradition, culture,
                                dresses, and exotic way of life</p>
                <h2>ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
                            <p>The language of Assamese is regarded as the lingua franca of the whole northeast India and its history is not been very clearly featured for there are records only dating from the 14th
                                century. The tribes of the Mongolian origin mainly occupy the hilly areas of the state. It was the Ahom dynasty which ruled the area for more than 600 years without any interruption. The
                                Mughal invaders tried to invade this hilly region for more than seventeen times but however it did not work. During this era, the Assamese society was exogenous. It was only in 1824 that
                                the British entered the state for plantation of tea and that's when the destruction of the Ahom dynasty started. During the entry of the British into Assam, immigrants from different parts
                                entered with varying traditional beliefs such as caste system and dowry system. Few of them who liked the place settled in Assam and formed their society strictly adhering to their
                                original traditions</p>
                <h2>CULTURE</h2>
                            <p>The Assamese are noted for their mixed traditional culture because of the assimilation of various ethno-cultural groups in the past including the local elements and the local elements in
                                Sanskritised forms can be seen. However the Assamese culture is greatly influenced by the Kamarupa Kingdom which had been grouped here for nearly 700 years. This was followed by
                                the Ahom dynasty during the 13th century which reigned for more than 600 years. Another milestone in the culture of the Assamese were the Koch Kingdom (15th–16th century AD) of
                                western Assam and Kachari Kingdom (12th–18th century AD) of central and southern Assam. During the 15th century the great Srimanta Sankardeva (Sonkordeu) and his disciples
                                started a religio-cultural movement namely the Vaishanav Movement, which paved way for another dimension to Assamese culture. </p>

                                followed by earlier generations which are widely accepted and strictly followed. Thus the Assamese also strictly adhere to such customs and traditions generated by their forefathers
                                pertaining to their community. The Assamese weddings, birth, festivals and even death include various customs and traditions which are supposed to be followed. The Assamese are very

                                guests. The Jaapi is mainly made of bamboo strips and a kind of dried palm leaves which is locally known as "Tokow Pat". Jaapi has a number of varities like Halua Jaapi, Pitha Jaapi,
                                Sorudoiya Jaapi, Bordoiya Jaapi, Cap, etc.In olden days the Assamese used these Jaapi's for the females of noble and rich families as their headwears.Sometims it is also used in the paddy
                                fields by the peasants as umbrellas. </p>
